# Tech-Track-22-23 - Similar Villagers for ACNH

Hello everyone. This is a school project for the minor: Information Design - Tech Track. In this project I created an app that shows similar villagers of ACNH and graphs that displays various information.

# License

I'm using the GNU general public license for my project.

# My deployed app

For various reasons that you can read about in my wiki, I deployed my app on both Vercel and Netlify. You can find the links to my app here:

Netlify: https://storied-yeot-db056a.netlify.app/
Vercel: https://tech-track-22-23-jet.vercel.app/

# How to start working on this project?

1. First you have to clone my repository in git locally with `git clone https://github.com/rvdegroen/Tech-Track-22-23.git` in the terminal
2. Secondly you have to install all dependencies with `npm install` in the terminal
3. To run the application locally, you can use `npm run dev` in the terminal
4. To deploy my application you can use Vercel. Here below you can read more on how to deploy this application:

# How to deploy on Vercel?

I'll be talking step by step on how to deploy your website with Vercel (by using a Github repository).

1. First you have to create an account on https://vercel.com/, you can do this with your Github (that's what I did).

2. When you come on the landing page of Vercel, you have to click on "add new" then "project".

3. Then you can choose your Github repository that you want to deploy and click on "import".

4. Lastly you can change stuff if you want, but Vercel should be able to configure everything for you automatically and then you can click on "deploy".
